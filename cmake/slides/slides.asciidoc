 * `make` build is specific to Unix/Linux.
 * Windows/Mac uses differnt build tools like Xcode, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc
 * Detects compile-time and run-time dependencies for the project

=== `CMake`

 * `CMakeLists.txt` is given as input to `cmake` tool.
 * `cmake` parses the file that helps it
    . Analyze the source files and their relationships
    . Understand the compile-time and run-time dependencies
    . Generate the required Build system for the project
