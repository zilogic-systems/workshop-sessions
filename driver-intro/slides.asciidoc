= Introduction to Drivers
Zilogic Systems

== What is a Driver?

=== Device Abstraction

  * OS objective: Abstract away the differences in the hardware from
    the applications

  * Each device has a software called a driver, that knows about the
    details of the device hardware

  * These drivers provide a consistent interface towards the
    application

=== Device Abstraction in Linux

  * Similarity between accessing I/O devices and acessing files

  * Data from I/O devices can be treated as a stream of bytes, just
    like files.

  * In Unix, everything is a file!

=== Device Files

  * Files can be broadly classified as plain files, directories and
    special or device file
    
  * Physical devices are accessed through device files

  * Device files are located in `/dev`

=== Example Device Files

------
/dev/hda, /dev/hdb - IDE Hardisk, CDROM
/dev/sda, /dev/sdb - SCSCI or SATA Hardisk
/dev/fd0	   - Floppy Drive
/dev/audio         - Sound Card
/dev/input/mice    - Mouse
/dev/mem	   - RAM
------

=== Working with Device Files

  * Reading and writing to the device files, will result in reading
    and writing to the devices
+
------
# cat /dev/input/mice
------
+
  * Moving the mouse, causes wierd characters getting
    dumped on the screen

  * Correlation between the mouse movements and the data from the
    device file

=== Mouse Event Format

  * For each mouse event 3 bytes are produced.

  * First byte contains bits to indicate which of the 3 mouse buttons
    was pressed.
+
------
Bit 0 - Left Button
Bit 1 - Right Button 
Bit 2 - Middle Button
------

=== Python Code

[source,python]
------
include::code/mouse.py[]
------

=== How Device Files Work

  * How does the operating system know that mouse events should be
    reported when `/dev/input/mice` is read?

  * `ls` on device files and ordinary files.
+
------
[~]$ ls -alh /dev/input/mice /dev/audio 
crw-rw---- 1 root audio 14,  4 2007-08-21 10:02 /dev/audio
crw-rw---- 1 root root  13, 63 2007-08-21 10:01 /dev/input/mice

[~]$ ls -alh *.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 vijay vijay  323K 2007-07-28 21:40 lcd-datasheet.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 vijay vijay 1023K 2007-08-19 18:05 radmind-solaris.pdf

== More fun with device files

=== Accessing the Audio Device

  * Device file: `/dev/audio`
  * Format: 1-channel, 8-bit, mu-law, sampling rate of 8kHz
+
------
[~]$ cat mysound.au > /dev/audio
------
+
  * Creating the file from `.mp3` file
------
[~]$ sox ~/song.mp3 -b 8 -e mu-law -c 1 -r 8000 song.au
------
   * `-b 8` specifies 8-bit, `-u` specifies mu-law, `-c` specifies mono
     (single-channel), `-r 8000` specifies 8kHz sampling rate.

=== Accessing the Hard Disk

   * Hard disk is usually accessed through the file system

   * Raw access the hard disk through the device files `/dev/hda`, `/dev/hdb`, etc

   * Sectors in the hard disk appear to be layed out sequentially when
     accessed through `/dev/hda`

=== Printing the Partition Table

  * Each sector is of 512 bytes.

  * The first sector of the hard disk is called the MBR.
 
  * The MBR contains a part of the boot loader, and the partition table.

  * The first 446 bytes contains the boot loader code.

  * The next 64 bytes contains the partition table.

  * The last 2 bytes contain magic nos. `55`, `AA`.

=== Printing the Partition Table (Contd.)
  
  * The partition table has four records, each of size 16 bytes.

  * Each record has the following format.

== Controlling Devices

=== Introduction

  * Reading and writing to device files translate really well to
    device I/O

  * Limits to the abstraction

  * Not possible to model all device operations as reading and writing
    to files

  * Example: Control and configuration of the device

=== IOCTL

  * Linux has a separate system call called `ioctl()` to deal with
    this.
+
------
ioctl(fd, request, [arg])
------

=== CDROM Tray Eject

  * Device File: `/dev/sr0`
  * Header file: `linux/cdrom.h`
  * IOCTL: `CDROMEJECT`

=== Code

[source,python]
------
include::code/eject.py[]
------

  * If `O_NONBLOCK` is not specified then opening the device file will
    fail, if there is no CD-ROM in the drive

  * Programmatic closing of the CD-ROM drive, using `CDROMCLOSETRAY`

=== Reading RTC

  * RTC (Real Time Clock) maintains the system time, even when the
    system is powered down

  * The RTC is backed up by a battery, and when the system powers up
    it reads the current time from the RTC

  * Date/time is read from the RTC using ioctls

=== Reading RTC (Contd.)

  * Device file: `/dev/rtc0`
  * Header file: `linux/rtc.h`
  * IOCTL: `RTC_RD_TIME`
  * Argument is a buffer where driver fills in the current time

=== Code

[source,python]
------
include::code/rtc.py[]
------

=== Volume Control

  * Device file: `/dev/mixer`
  * Header file: `linux/soundcard.h`.
  * IOCTL: `SOUND_MIXER_READ_VOLUME`, `SOUND_MIXER_WRITE_VOLUME`
  * Argument is a buffer containing an integer
    - byte 0 represents the left volume
    - byte 1 represents the right volume

=== Code

[source,python]
------
include::code/volume.py[]
------

== Resource

=== File: `ioctl.py`

[source,python]
------
include::code/ioctl.py[]
------

=== File: `ioctl_util.py`

[source,python]
------
include::code/ioctl_util.py[]
------
