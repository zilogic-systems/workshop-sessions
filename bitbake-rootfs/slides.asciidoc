= Rootfs with BitBake
Zilogic Systems

== Intro to Zepto

=== Building Models

  * Complex systems can be easily understood by building simple
    working models

  * Scientists and engineers do this often

  * Models highlight the essence of the system

  * Removes away the clutter, the tiny implementation details

  * Zepto, a working prototype of Yocto

  * Built incrementally, introducing only one feature at a time

== Zepto v1

=== Overview

  * Bash and Coreutils build are written as recipes
  * `ROOTFS` is set in `bitbake.conf`
  * Common recipe code is put up in `base.bbclass`

=== Try Out

  * Setup bitbake first
  * Setup `BBPATH`
  * Build and install bash
  * Verify in `tmp/rootfs`
  * Build and install coreutils
  * Verify in `tmp/rootfs`

== Zepto v2

=== Issue

  * Lot of common build instructions in `configure`, `compile` and
    `install` tasks.

  * Same for all packages using autotools.

=== Solution

  * BitBake allows creating additional class files

  * Classes can be selectively included using `inherit` directive

  * Tasks common to subset of recipes can be shared

=== Overview

  * `classes/autotools.bbclass` contains generic version of
    `configure`, `compile` and `install` tasks.

  * `PN` and `PV` are used to make the tasks generic

  * Recipes `inherit` and use tasks from autotools class

  * If need be tasks can be redefined, or appended to

== Zepto v3

=== Simplify Download

  * BitBake provides helper functions that can simplify fetching
    source code

  * Unified interface to fetch from various sources

  * Support to check for corruption / tampering of source

  * Support for mirrors to reduce download times

  * Support for unpacking source files in various formats

=== Overview

  * `classes/base.bbclass` contains generic versions of `fetch` and
    `unpack`

  * Written as Python tasks, invokes the `Fetcher` module provided by
    BitBake

  * Modified to use a per-package work directory, where source code
    will be extracted

  * The `DL_DIR` specifies the location for downloaded source code

=== Try Out

  * Setup bitbake first
  * Setup `BBPATH`
  * Add a recipe for ncurses
    - `http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.9.tar.gz`
  * Add a recipe for less
    - `http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/less-458.tar.gz`
  * Specify less depends on ncurses

== Zepto v4

=== Overview

  * Support creation of images
  * Separate recipe to copy libraries from toolchain directory
