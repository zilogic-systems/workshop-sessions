= Embedded Linux Introduction

== Embedded Systems

=== Embedded Vs Open Systems

* *Embedded System* - Programmable electronics system immersed in a
  larger physical system, and has fixed functionalities.

* *Open System* - General purpose system which is inter-operable and
  sticks to open standards, whose hardware and software features are
  scaleable and extensible.

* We are in an era of *Hybrid embedded systems*, where the devices built
  has mixed properties of both embedded system and open system.

* Currently the specific purpose embedded systems are classified as
  *deeply embedded systems*.

=== Embedded Software Model 

* Mostly in deeply embedded systems monolithic binary image of
  software called as *firmware* is developed.
 
* In mid level embedded systems the minimalist *multi-threaded OS or
  real-time OS (RTOS)* is used along with the application code to
  build the firmware image.

* In above firmware model the software features are freezed at compile
  time itself and it cannot be scaled at later point.

* The high level embedded systems are hybrid and uses *general purpose
  operating systems (GPOS)*.

They are used in

  * Telecom

  * Network

  * Consumer electronics

=== General Purpose Operating System

[role="left"]

 * It would be multi-layered with multiple software components
   integrated together.

 * Follows open standards like POSIX

 * Applications can be installed or removed at runtime.

 * Applications are untrusted by OS and are provided less privileges.

 * Linux, BSD, MAC, Windows etc.,

== Linux

=== What is Linux

  * *Unix-like:* a GPOS provides an interface similar to the Unix
    operating system developed by Bell labs.

  * *multi-tasking:* many different applications at the same time

  * *multi-user:* many different users can use the system 

  * *cross-platform:* supports wide variety of hardware - desktops,
    mainframes, supercomputers, gaming stations, mobile phones,
    routers, etc.

== Linux Usage

[role="two-column"]
=== User Interaction
[role="left"]
  * User can interact to an UNIX system through `shell` or through
    `desktop environment`.

  * A shell is a command line application provides a means for
    navigating through the file system, and launching other programs
    on request.

  * Desktop environment is the graphical replacement for shell and
    provides much more convenience for desktop users.

=== Files in Linux

  * Files in GNU/Linux can be broadly classified as follows:
    Regular files, Directories, Links & Device files

  * In GNU/Linux every device is represented by a file in `/dev`
    directory. For example `/dev/sda` represents the hard disk,
    `/dev/ttyS0` represents the serial port, `/dev/input/mice`
    represents the mouse, ...

  * Reading/writing to and from the device file, results in reading
    from/writing to the device. To get mouse events the following
    command can be used.

=== File System Tree

  * File - important abstraction in Linux.

  * A file system tree, with all the necessary files is required for
    Linux system to boot.

  * Import files present in the file system tree include
    - system programs
    - application programs
    - configuration files
    - device files

=== Layout

===  Need for a File Systems

  * Data corresponding to a file are stored in sectors of the
    hard-disk.

image::figures/no-fs.png[width=388, align="center"]
    
  * User has to remember the sectors that store the contents of a file.

  * The user also has to keep track of which sectors are free.

  * Managing files becomes tedious.

  * The filesystem maintains a table, that maps filenames to the
    sectors that contain the contents of the file.

== Embedded Linux

=== Why Embedded Linux?

.Pros

  * No royalties or licensing fee.
  * Support is available from the community, as well from multiple
    vendors. This avoids vendor lock in.
  * Linux kernel supports a wide range of microprocessors and
    peripherals devices.
  * Re-use existing Linux application base.
  * Re-use existing Linux resource pool in embedded systems.

=== Why Embedded Linux Contd.

.Cons

  * Large memory foot print.

  * The stock kernel only offers soft real-time capabilities. Third
    party patches are available for latency reduction and adding hard
    real-time capabilities.

=== What is Embedded Linux

  * Customizing the Linux and its allies for a custom target board.
    - adding additional software for embedded interfaces
    - removing unnecessary components to reduce time and space 

[style="two-column"]
=== Target Hardware Components

[role="left"]
  * Processor
  * Flash
  * SDRAM
  * Serial Port
  * Ethernet

[role="right"]

[role="two-column"]
=== Development Setup

[role="left"]
  * Host System - development env.

  * Target System - execution env.

  * The application running in the target system read input from the
    serial port, and send output to the serial port.

  * In other words, the standard input and standard output of the
    applications is attached to the serial port.

  * Host system uses a serial terminal program like `minicom` and
    `putty` to communicate with the target system.

  * Kernel image and filesystem image download is done through
    Ethernet interface. Serial interface is not fast enough.

=== Linux Software Components

A bare minimal Linux system needs atleast below components.

[role="left"]
  * Boot Loader
  * Kernel
  * File System
    - C library
    - Shell & Utilities
    - Init & Boot Scripts

[role="right"]
image::figures/boot-timeline.png[width=588]

=== Boot Loader

  * Low-level hardware initialisation, memory controller
    initialisation, cache initialisation
 
  * Provide a mechanism to locate, load and execute kernel with
    necessary parameter.

  * Popular embedded boot loaders are
    - U-boot
    - Redboot, uses drivers from eCOS RTOS.

=== Kernel

  * Create higher level abstractions like files, processes, pipes,
       sockets, etc on top of the hardware.

  * Manage sharing of system resources - CPU, Memory, Devices.

== File System

=== File System Format

  * Specifies how files are laid out in a storage medium.

  * Various filesystem drivers are available like

    - *ext2/ext3/vfat* - filesystems commonly used in desktops

    - *jffs2* - filesystem tuned for Flash based memory devices

  * Pseudo filesystems are in-memory file systems which don't persist
    the data, rather provides realtime information.  
    - *proc:* process and kernel related information 
    - *sysfs:* kernel devices related information
    
=== Rootfs Contents

The rootfs has required files for system to function and user to
use. Bare minimal rootfs would have atleast

 * libraries required by applications

 * Shell

 * Initscripts to initialize the system
 
=== Storage for Embedded Systems

  * Hard disks are not suitable for embedded systems
    - Contain moving parts
    - Sensitive to physical shock
    - Requires multiple power supply voltages

  * Replaced by non-volatile memory devices - Flash

  * Embedded Linux systems require > 4MB of Flash memory.

=== Tryout

* Use Putty in Windows or Minicom to access debug console of board.

  - Check the `COM` number from `device manager` in Windows or
    `ttyUSBx` node from `dmesg` of Linux.
  - Use baudrate as `115200`, data config as `8N1` and flow control as
    `none`.
  - reset the board and observe the bootloader and kernel boot flow.
 
* In target board 

  - Try to print the CPU details from `/proc/cpuinfo` using `cat`.

  - Try to print the memory usage info from `/proc/meminfo`

  - Try to print NAND memory size from `/proc/mtd`

  - Try listing the contents of `/` using `ls`
