== Using Qemu

[role="two-column"]
=== Qemu, Introduction

[role="left"]
image::figures/qemu.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * Emulates a full system -- processor and peripherals

  * Can emulate various architectures including x86, ARM, SPARC,
    PowerPC

  * Operating Systems like Linux and Windows can be run within the
    emulated system

  * Useful for testing and developing Embedded Systems

  * Android emulator is a modified version of Qemu

[role="two-column"]
=== ARM Emulation

[role="left"]
image::figures/gumstix.jpg[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * Supported ARM SoCs include Exynos4210, PXA255, PXA270, OMAP2420,
    LM3S811

  * Versatile Platform Baseboard -- an extensible system from ARM,
    will be used for development

  * By default Versatile Platform Board emulation uses an ARM926EJ-S
    core

[role="two-column"]
=== Comparison to VirtualBox

[role="left"]
image::figures/virtualbox-logo.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * Support non-native architectures unlike VirtualBox

  * Qemu relies on KVM, for acceleration

  * Runs slow on Windows compared to VirtualBox

[role="two-column"]
=== Built-in Bootloader

[role="left"]
image::figures/kernel-boot.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * Bootloader -- loads Operating System kernel from disk to memory,
    and transfers control to it

  * Qemu has a built-in bootloader

  * Given a kernel, Qemu copies it to memory, and sets the Program
    Counter to the kernel's entry point

  * Boot arguments to the kernel can be specified

=== Shared Folder

  * Target emulation is done outside VirtualBox, on the host

  * Shared folder
    - Transfer kernel and disk images, out of VirtualBox
    - Used to test against the target, emulated by Qemu

  * Set the environment variable `SHARED` to point to the shared
    folder

=== Invoking Qemu

Create a file in `$SHARED` called `run-qemu.sh`.

[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/boot-prebuilt.sh[]
------

`-M`:: Specifies the machine type. `versatilepb` for Versatile Platform Board.
`-hda`:: Specifies the hard disk image.

=== Invoking Qemu (Contd.)

Create a file in `$SHARED` called `run-qemu.sh`.

[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/boot-prebuilt.sh[]
------

`-kernel`:: Specifies the kernel image filename

`-append`:: Specifies the kernel boot argument. `root=/dev/sda rw`
            specifies the root should be mounted from the harddisk

=== Boot Prebuilt

  * In the guest, copy the pre-built images to the shared folder
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/copy-prebuilt.sh[]
------
+
  * In the host, invoke Qemu using `run-qemu.sh`

== Minimal Filesystem V0

=== //

[role="tip"]
Rootfs contains only a Hello World program.

[role="two-column"]
=== Directories

[role="left"]
------
yp
 + pre-built
   + zImage
   + disk.img
 + dl
   + bash-4.3.tar.gz
   + coreutils-8.32.tar.xz
 + manual
   + rootfs
   + disk.img
-------

[role="right"]
  * `~/yp/pre-built`: contains pre-built kernel and root filesystem images
  * `~/yp/dl`: contains files downloaded from the Internet
  * `~/yp/manual`: the manual build directory
  * `~/yp/manual/rootfs`: contains the root filesystem

=== Setup Environment

Setup the following environment variables, to save typing.

[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/setup-env.sh[]
------

=== Create Hello World Program

Create `~/yp/manual/hello.c`, with the following content, using a text editor.

[source,c]
------
include::cmd/hello.c[]
------

=== Cross-Compile Hello World

  * The cross-compiler toolchain has the prefix
    `arm-linux-gnueabi-`
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/build-hello.sh[]
------
+
  * `-static` specifies that the program should be linked statically
  * All library functions will be included into the executable

=== Create the Rootfs

  * Copy the `hello` executable into the root filesystem
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/copy-hello.sh[]
------
+
  * Create EXT2 filesystem image using `genext2fs`
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/create-hello-rootfs.sh[]
------
+
  * `-b` option specifies the size of the rootfs in blocks (of size
    1024 bytes)

  * `-d` specifies the directory containing the rootfs

=== Boot the Kernel with Hello

  * Boot the kernel with new disk image.
  * Kernel after boot up checks for `/sbin/init`.
  * If not found it tries to execute `/bin/sh`

== Minimal Filesystem V1

=== //

[role="tip"]
Rootfs contains only the shell.

=== Building Bash

  * Very very minimal system -- kernel boots up and runs the shell

  * Download bash from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3.tar.gz
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/download-bash.sh[]
------
+
  * Unpack the source tar ball
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/unpack-bash.sh[]
------

=== Building Bash (2)

  * Configure for cross-compilation
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/configure-bash.sh[]
------
+
  * Building the programs
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/build-bash.sh[]
------

=== Install Bash

  * Installing into root filesystem
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/install-bash.sh[]
------
+
  * Shell scripts expect to find `bash` in `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`.

  * But `bash` is located in `/usr/bin/bash`. Link it into `/bin`
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/link-bash.sh[]
------

=== Determine the Dependencies

  * The `bash` executable requires certain libraries to execute --
    `libc.so.6` and `libdl.so.2`.
+
[source,shell]
-----
include::cmd/check-bash-deps.sh[]
-----

=== Copy the Dependencies

  * Available from the toolchain location
+
[source,shell]
-----
include::cmd/cp-bash-deps.sh[]
-----

=== Copy the Dependencies (2)

  * Any program using dynamic libraries requires the dynamic linker
    `ld-linux.so.3`
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/copy-ld.sh[]
------

=== Add Required Directories

[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/make-dev-tmp.sh[]
------

  * `/dev` is required for device files
  * `/tmp` is required for creating temporary files

=== Create the Harddisk Image

  * Create EXT2 filesystem image using `genext2fs`
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/create-bash-rootfs.sh[]
------

=== Boot the Kernel Image

  * Boot the kernel with new disk image.

  * Basic navigation command works, but `ls` doesn't.

  * Use `echo *` instead!

== Minimal Filesystem V2

=== //

[role="tip"]
Add basic filesystem commands like `ls`.

=== Improvements

  * A filesystem without `ls` is pretty hard to work with.

  * Let's get `ls` to work.

  * `ls` is part of the `coreutils` package.

=== Download and Install `coreutils`

[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/build-coreutils.sh[]
------

=== Recreate Disk Image

  * Recreate the disk image and boot.
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/create-ls-rootfs.sh[]
------
+
  * Try the new root filesystem. Check if `ls` works.

=== //

[role="tip"]
Oops! What did we miss?

=== Determine the Dependencies

  * Determine the dependencies and copy them to the root filesystem
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/check-ls-deps.sh[]
------
+
  * Rebuild the image, and boot

=== //

[role="tip"]
Still missing something?

=== Libraries Have Dependencies

  * `librt` depends on `libpthread`!

  * Copy `libpthread`, rebuild the image and boot

  * Phew!

== Minimal Filesystem V3

=== //

[role="tip"]
Add support for the `less` pager

=== Support for `less`

  * `less` is not a terribly important tool

  * But we will be building it to demonstrate library dependencies

=== Download and Configure `less`

------
include::cmd/build-less-fail.sh[]
------

  * Configure fails due to a missing dependency on `libncurses`.

  * `libncurses` is not provided as part of the toolchain.

=== Download and Install `libncurses`

------
include::cmd/build-ncurses.sh[]
------

=== Re-configure `less`

------
include::cmd/build-less-fail-2.sh[]
------

=== Locating Header Files and Libraries

  * The build system is not able to find `libncurses`
  * The header files and library files are not on the standard search
    path
  * Additional paths need to specified using `-I` and `-L` options to
    the preprocessor and linker

=== Include and Library Path

Create a file called `~/yp/manual/hello-ncurses.c`, with the following content.

[source,c]
------
include::cmd/hello-ncurses.c[]
------

=== Include and Library Path (2)

  * Try compiling with the cross-compiler
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/build-hello-ncurses.sh[]
------
+
  * The header file is installed in `$ROOTFS/usr/include`, the library
    file is installed in `$ROOTFS/usr/lib`
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/check-ncurses-location.sh[]
------

=== Include and Library Path (3)

   * Add these paths to the preprocessor and linker search paths
+
[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/build-hello-ncurses-2.sh[]
------
+
   * These paths needs to added while running the `configure` script

=== Re-configure `less`

  * Configure allows additional variables to be set in the command
    line.
+
------
./configure --help
Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
------
+
  * Variables `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` can be set, to pass
    preprocessor and linker options

  * Add location of `libncurses` header files by setting
    `CPPFLAGS="-I $ROOTFS/usr/include"`.

  * Add location of `libncurses` library files by setting
    `LDFLAGS="-L $ROOTFS/usr/lib"`

=== Re-configure `less` (2)

[source,shell]
------
include::cmd/build-less.sh[]
------

=== Boot and Test `less`

  * Rebuild the disk image, and boot
  * Test `less` as indicated below

------
ls /dev | less
------
