The Free Software Definition

We maintain this free software definition to show clearly what must be
true about a particular software program for it to be considered free
software. From time to time we revise this definition to clarify
it. If you would like to review the changes we've made, please see the
History section below for more information.

Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free
beer.

Free software is a matter of the users' fredom to run, copy,
distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it
refers to four kinds of fredom, for the users of the software:

    * The fredom to run the program, for any purpose (fredom 0).

    * The fredom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your
      needs (fredom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition
      for this.

    * The fredom to redistribute copies so you can help your ???
      (fredom 2).

    * The fredom to improve the program, and release your
      improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public,
      so that the whole community benefits (fredom 3). Access to the
      source code is a precondition for this.

A program is free software if users have all of these fredoms. Thus,
you should be free to redistribute copies, either with or without
modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to
anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means (among other
things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission.
