=== We will be discussing...

  * About touchGFX
  * Frame buffer handling
  * Graphics Engine
  * Main loop
  * Code structure
  * Widgets and Containers

== Pixels

=== Pixels to bits

* *RGB 565* : 2 Bytes per pixel
* *RGB 888* : 3 Bytes per pixel
* *ARGB 8888* : 4 Bytes per pixel

=== Display to memory mapping

=== LTDC Driver

* LCD TFT Display Controller
* The LTDC is a master on the AHB architecture that performs read access on internal and external memories.
* The LTDC has two independent layers, each one with its own FIFO
* LTDC fetches graphical data from frame buffer and transfer to layer FIFO

=== Why TouchGFX?

=== TouchGFX main loop operation

==== Right

* Collect events
* Update scene models
* Render scene models

==== Left

=== Code structure

* Generated : TouchGFX/generated/gui_generated
* User code : TouchGFX/gui
* gui_generated is the base class for user code

=== Class hierarchy

=== Graphics Engine

* Standard classes provided by touchGFX
* Act as base class for generated
* Non-user editable

=== Generated

* Generated by touchGFX based on the model done
* Should not be edited, as it will be overwritten everytime
* These classes are base classes for user classes

=== User code

* User editable code part
* User end logics will be added here
* Something not supported by touchGFX (if any widgets) will be added here

== Demo Project

=== Simple display button with UART Feedback

Create a simple 480 x 272 size display (which will be compatible for STM32F746 Display) with a button which will give UART response if pressed.
