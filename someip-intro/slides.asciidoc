= SOME/IP Introduction
Zilogic Systems <training@zilogic.com>

== Background

=== Communication between controllers in Automotives

 * Various controllers communicating with each other
 * CAN Bus - limited bandwidth
 * High bandwidth requirements like Video, Audio & OTA
 * Ethernet is a high bandwidth medium

=== Overview

 * Ethernet uses the TCP/IP stack layer for communication

 * Remote Procedure Calls(RPC) using traditional Request-Response model not
   sufficient

 * Requirements for Notification of certain events to the Clients (i.e
   controllers)

 * Subscription/Notification Mechanism is required

 * Higher level protocol required in the Application layers of the TCP/IP stack
   to address these requirements.

== SOME/IP Introduction

=== What is SOME/IP?

 * Scalabale service-Oriented middlewarE over IP
 * Designed for Automotive use cases
 * Three main parts to SOME/IP:
   ** On-wire format
   ** Protocol
   ** Service Discovery

== On-Wire format

=== SOME/IP Message format

 * Consists of messages sent between devices in a particular format.

 * SOME/IP Message has two parts: **Header** and **Payload**

=== SOME/IP Message format

=== Header fields

 * `Service ID` : unique identifier for each service
 * `Method ID` : 0-32767 for methods, 32768-65535 for events
 * `Length` : length of payload in byte
 * `Client ID` : unique identifier for the calling client inside the ECU; has to be unique in the overall vehicle
 * `Session ID` : identifier for session handling; has to be incremented for each call
 * `Protocol Version` : 0x01
 * `Interface Version` : major version of the service interface

=== Message Type

[options="header",width="50%",align="center"]
|======
| TYPE | VALUE
| REQUEST | 0x00
| REQUEST_NO_RETURN	    | 0x01
| NOTIFICATION | 0x02
| RESPONSE | 0x80
|======

=== Return Code

[options="header",width="50%",align="center"]
|======
| TYPE | VALUE
| E_OK	    | 0x00
| E_NOT_OK  | 0x01
| E_WRONG_INTERFACE_VERSION | 0x08
| E_MALFORMED_MESSAGE | 0x09
| E_WRONG_MESSAGE_TYPE | 0x0A
|======

== SOME/IP Protocol

=== Overview

 * Transport bindings used are either UDP or TCP
 * Communication patterns are
   ** Publish/Subscribe
   ** Request/Response

=== Transport Bindings - UDP

 * SOME/IP Messages are not fragmented (partial)
 * Multiple SOME/IP messages can be sent in a single UDP message
 * Maximum size of SOME/IP message using UDP is 1400

=== Transport Bindings - TCP

 * SOME/IP Message greater than 1400 must use TCP

=== SOME/IP Protocol

=== SOME/IP Protocol

 * REQUEST/RESPONSE mechanism is for Remote Procedure Calls(RPC)
 * PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE pattern is for events.
 * Events are grouped in an Event Group.
 * Subscription happens only to event groups and not to an individual event.

== SOME/IP Service Discovery

=== SOME/IP SD - Overview

 * Subscription to a service happens through SOME/IP SD.

 * This layer is used to locate service instances and detect if service
   instances are running

 * Each device broadcasts offer messages containing all the services which are
   offered by it
