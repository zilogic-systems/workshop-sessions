== Simple Single File Model

=== Basic Requirements

  * Store each revision of the project.

  * Retrieve the state of the project at a specified revision

[role="two-column"]
=== Single File Model

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + file.txt.v1
| | + file.txt.v2
| | + file.txt.v3
| + master
|
+ file.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * Repository has directory called `objects`
  * When user wants to take a snapshot: copy `file.txt` into `objects`
  * The filename is suffixed with revision no. of the file

[role="two-column"]
=== Single File Model (Contd.)

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + file.txt.v1
| | + file.txt.v2
| | + file.txt.v3
| + master
|
+ file.txt
------
 
[role="right"]
  * When a new version is added the file will have the suffix `.v4`
  * `master` holds the name of the latest revision

=== DVCS

image::figures/dvcs.png[align="center",width="60%"]

[width="50%"]
Distributed versions control systems allows each user to create
commits, in their local repo.

=== SHA1

  * Idea: Use SHA1 sum of the content to identify the file.
  * SHA1 is similar to checksum algorithms: but 20-bytes long
  * Interesting property: no two files will have the same
    checksum. (very low probability)
  * Depicted as a 40 digit hex number: 4c7be7b2c3641a5e489c4ce667699eeee4e994c9
  * Only first 7 digits are shown: 4c7be7b

=== SHA1 Demo

------
$ echo "Hello World" > test.txt
$ sha1sum test.txt
648a6a6ffffdaa0badb23b8baf90b6168dd16b3a  test.txt

$ echo "Hallo World" > test.txt
$ sha1sum test.txt
c54c65218154f15c32ca252946786e0ad09aa99b  test.txt

SHA1 Collision: http://stackoverflow.com/q/1867191

=== Using SHA1

image::figures/dvcs-sha1.png[align="center"]

== SHA1 Single File Model

[role="two-column"]
=== Storing file using SHA1

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + 4c7be7b...
| | + c9360f5...
| | + da39a3e...
| + master
|
+ file.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * Using SHA1 avoids collision

  * But the ordering of the commits is lost

  * Latest revision is in `master`

  * But previous revision is not known!

  * No meta information about the changes: who? why? when?

=== Ordering Lost

image::figures/no-commit-objects.png[align="center",width="40%"]

== Ordered Single File Model

[role="tip"]
=== //

Add support for storing order of commits.

=== Commit Object

  * Regular files stored in the repo are called "blob"s

  * Objects representing commits are stored in the repo: commit object
  
  * Each commit object gets its own SHA1

  * Contains the following information
    - log message
    - author name
    - time of commit
    - SHA1 of the blob, that belongs to the commit
    - SHA1 of the parent commit object

=== Ordering Regained

image::figures/commit-objects.png[align="center",width="40%"]

[role="two-column"]
=== Blobs + Commit Objects

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + 4c7be7b... # B
| | + c9360f5... # B
| | + da39a3e... # B
| | + 5d7be7c... # C
| | + da470f6... # C
| | + cb2aa3f... # C
| |
| + master
|
+ file.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * Repo stores commit objects and blobs.

  * The `master` contains SHA1 of the commit object, now.

== Detached Head Model

[role="tip"]
=== //

Add support for tracking current checkout revision.

=== Which is my head?

  * If latest revision is checked out, the model works fine

  * If an older revision is checked out, we need to keep track of it

  * This is required for example, when a diff is done

[role="two-column"]
=== Tracking Head

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + 4c7be7b...
| | + c9360f5...
| | + da39a3e...
| | + 5d7be7c...
| | + da470f6...
| | + cb2aa3f...
| |
| + master
| + HEAD
|
+ file.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * `master` should always point to the latest revision

  * Expand our model, with a another file `HEAD`

    - Contains the text `master`, if working copy is the latest revision
    - Contains the SHA1SUM of the commit, otherwise

== Multi-Branch Model

[role="tip"]
=== //

Add support for tracking multiple branches.

[role="two-column"]
=== Storing Branches 

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + 4c7be7b...
| |   ...
| |
| + refs
| | + heads
| |   + master
| |   + year-fix
| |
| + HEAD
|
+ file.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * A directory called `refs/heads` contains one file for each branch
  * Each file contains the SHA1 of the latest commit
  * HEAD contains
    - The path to the current branch
    - Or the SHA1 of a commit, if detached

[role="two-column"]
=== Storing Branches (Contd.)

[role="left"]
------
proj/
+ .git/
| + objects/
| | + 4c7be7b...
| |   ...
| |
| + refs
| | + heads
| |   + master
| |   + year-fix
| |
| + HEAD
|
+ file.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * HEAD specifies the branch to advance when a commit is done
  * Branches are extremely light weight.
  * Branch creation: creating a file, with the SHA1 of commit.

== Merge Commit Model

[role="tip"]
=== //

Add support for tracking branch merges.

[role="two-column"]
=== Branch Merges

[role="left"]
image::figures/merge-commit.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * When two branches that have diverged are merged, a merge commit is
    created

  * Unlike regular commit objects, the merge commit will have more
    than one parent

  * The commit objects, will store the SHA1 of both the parent
    commits

== Multi-File Model

[role="tip"]
=== //

Add support for handling multiple files.

[role="two-column"]
=== Multiple Files

[role="left"]
image::figures/tree.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * Multiple files are present in the project

  * Each file is stored in the object database just as before

  * Another object called the Tree object, is used to group the files

  * The Tree object, contains the filenames and their SHA1s

  * Commit object refers to the Tree object

[role="two-column"]
=== Hierarchy of Files and Directories

[role="left"]
------
proj/
  a.txt
  b.txt
  mydir/
    c.txt
    d.txt
------

[role="right"]
  * Tree object can be used recursively to store a hierarchy of files
    and directories

  * A single SHA1 specifies the state of entire project hierarchy

[role="two-column"]
=== Hierarchy of Files and Directories

[role="left"]
image::figures/sub-tree.png[align="center",width="80%"]

[role="right"]
  * Tree object can be used recursively to store a hierarchy of files
    and directories

  * A single SHA1 specifies the state of entire project hierarchy

[role="two-column"]
=== Space Savings

[role="left"]
image::figures/duplicate-files.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * SHA1 of files with duplicate content is the same

  * Duplicate files are stored only once

=== Space Savings Across Commits

image::figures/duplicate-files-across-commits.png[align="center",width="50%"]

== Exploring a Git Repo

=== Try Out: Initial Contents

------
$ mkdir proj
$ cd proj
$ git init
$ find .git
------

=== Try Out: Exploring a Commit

------
$ echo "This is a simple hello world file." > hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit -a -m "Added hello.txt."
$ find .git
------

  * Use `git show --pretty=raw <sha1>` to view the commit object
  * Use `git ls-tree <sha1>` to view the tree object
  * Use `git show` to view the blob

=== Try Out: Handling Duplicates

  * Create a copy of `hello.txt` and commit it
+
------
$ cp hello.txt world.txt
$ git add world.txt
$ git commit -a -m "Added world.txt."
------
+
  * Verify that there is only one object for in the object database,
    for both the `hello.txt` and `world.txt`

=== Try Out: Branches

  * Find out the current commit SHA1, using `git log`
  * Create a branch called `my-branch`
+
------
$ git checkout -b my-branch
------
+
  * Verify that a branch has been using the `find` command

  * Verify the file `.git/refs/heads/mybranch`, contains the current
    commit SHA1

  * Verify `.git/HEAD` points to the branch

=== Merges

  * Create commit on the branch

  * Checkout `master` and create another commit

  * Merge the branch

  * Verify that the commit object has two parents

== Staging

=== Tangled Working Copy Problem

  * You are working on Chapter 2, of the book

  * Adding a paragraph at the beginning that provides an overview of
    the chapter

  * You are not happy with the changes made

  * It's late into the night, you turn-off your computer and go to
    sleep

=== Tangled Working Copy Problem (Contd.)

  * You wake-up next morning, and review the contents of the book,
    while sipping your morning coffee

  * You notice that there is a spelling mistake in `chapter-1.txt` and
    `chapter-2.txt`.

  * The word "freedom" is spelled out as "fredom"

  * You immediately do a find and replace on the word and correct the
    spelling mistake

=== Tangled Working Copy Problem (Contd.)

  * You want to commit this spelling mistake fix, and you do a diff to
    verify before the commit

  * It is now that you realize that you were already working on a
    change, to Chapter 2.

  * You do not want to commit the paragraph that you added to Chapter
    2, but you want commit the spelling fixes

=== Staging

  * Git's staging feature addresses exactly this problem

  * Changes to be part of the commit can be "staged"

  * And staged changes can be committed

=== Using Staging (1)

image::figures/stage-1.png[align="center"]

=== Using Staging (2)

image::figures/stage-2.png[align="center"]

=== Using Staging (3)

image::figures/stage-3.png[align="center"]

=== Using Staging (4)

image::figures/stage-4.png[align="center"]

=== Staging Commands

  * Files can be staged using `git stage`
+
------
$ git stage chapter-1.txt
------
+
  * Staged files can be committed using, `git commit`, without the
    `-a` option.
+
------
$ git commit
------

=== Staging Commands

  * View files that have been staged
+
------
$ git status
------
+
  * Show the following categories of files

    - Files that have been staged
    - Files that have been changed but not staged
    - Files that are not tracked

=== Staging Hunks

  * `chapter-2.txt` has two unrelated changes in a single file

  * Specific hunks in a file can be staged using `--patch` option
+
------
$ git stage --patch chapter-2.txt
------
+
  * The file to be committed will have only those changes


=== Staging Hunks (2)

  * For each modified hunk, Git will prompt
+
------
Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,K,j,J,g,e,?]?
------
+
    - `y` - stage the hunk
    - `n` - do not stage the hunk
    - `q` - do not stage this hunk, and any of the remaining ones
    - `a` - stage this hunk, and all later hunks in the file
    - `s` - split the hunk into smaller hunks

=== Unstaging Files and Hunks

  * Files can be unstaged using `git reset`
+
------
git reset chapter-2.txt
------
+
  * Hunks in a file can be unstaged using
+
------
git reset --patch chapter-2.txt
------
    
=== Three Diff Types
