== I2C Bus - Overview

=== History

  * `Inter-Integrated Circuit` (I2C) is a low speed serial bus.

  * Developed by Philips for a TV set.

  * It connects peripheral devices to Microcontroller Unit.

  * No. of wires reduced to two (clock and data) for connecting devices.

  * To avoid EMI and ESD while memory mapped I/O.

=== Features

  * It operates at one of the clock rates,
    - 100kHz - Standard mode.
    - 400kHz - Fast mode.
    - 1  MHz - Fast+ mode.
    - 3.4MHz - High Speed mode.

  * The CPU is the master on the bus, and the peripherals are
    slaves. Only the master can initiate a transaction.

  * Each slave will have 7-bit address.

[role="right"]
  * Master provides clock and starts transaction.

  * The master can address a peripheral and send data to it, or
    receive data from it.

  * If 7-bit address is used, maximum of 127 devices can be connected.

[role="right"]
  * SoC's CPU is memory mapped to I2C controller.

  * Each I2C controller owns a bus.

  * Example: If 2x I2C controller in Soc, 2x I2C Bus.

== I2C Protocol

=== I2C Transactions

An I2C transaction between a master and a slave can be broken down to
two phases.

  * Address Phase
  * Data Phase

=== Register transactions

For accessing the slave registers, master has to

  * Write the register address to be accessed.

  * Then read or write data to the device.

  * For transactions which involves both write and read operations,
    a re-start needs to happen.

== Applications

=== Communication Interface

  * To interface IO expanders.

  * To interface with ADC and DAC.

  * To interface touch screen.

  * Used in many sound cards in configuration.

  * and so on...

== I2C in Target Board

[role="left"]
The following devices are connected on board,

  * RTC

  * Accelerometer

  * 4-way key.

== I2C in Linux

=== File interface

  * In Linux, I2C Bus can be accessed like a file.

  * It can be accessed using a dev interface, `/dec/i2c-<bus no.>`.

  * Doing fileio operations on this device file, will be reflected as
    send and receive transactions in the bus.

=== i2ctools

  * A set of tools to access I2C in linux.

  * `i2cdetect` provides the list of device addresses, connected in
    the bus.

== Accessing I2C Device

=== SMBus

  * Normal and register transaction methods.

  * FileIO operations are not sufficient to select and register access
    I2C devices.

  * For operations more than fileIO, we need to use `ioctl`.

  * Extra `ioctl` operations while accessing the i2c devices can be
    done using `SMBus`.

  * Download
    link:{include:code/smbus.py.datauri}["SMBus library here",filename="smbus.py"]

  * SMBus provides apis for selecting the I2C slave.


=== SMBus

  * Opening and reading the device requires the following steps.

[source, py]
------
include::code/smbus-access.py[]

===  Demo

  * Accessing Accelerometer

  * Download
    link:{include:code/accelerometer.py.datauri}["Accerlerometer Demo",filename="accelerometer.py"]


=== 4-way Key Datasheet

=== Try Out

  * Try to access 4-way key.

  * Detect the device is connected in the bus.

  * Read the status register and data register.

  * Use smbus apis to read current key value.
