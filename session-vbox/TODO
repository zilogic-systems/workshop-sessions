== TODO

 * Build script needs to be made idempotent.

 * Need to speed up build using apt cache.

 * Add minicom default configuration file.

== Known Issues

 * Vagrant adds the default shared folder mapping, but fails to mount
   it. This is temporarily fixed by manually selecting the
   "Auto-mount" option availabe in VirtualBox GUI under "Shared
   Folders" section.

 * Packed Vagrantfile is not initialized for some reason.

 * Defining no. of cpus in "Vagrantfile" does not work.

 * Network communication problems occur with USB 2.0 & 3.0.

 * Avoid building modules in shared folder as the filesystem does not
   support linux permissions and symbolic links.
