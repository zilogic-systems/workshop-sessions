= BitBake, Introduction
Zilogic Systems

== Integration Build

=== Makefile to Build Bash

[source,Makefile]
------
include::code/Makefile.bash[]
------

=== Limitations

  * Every time `make` is invoked, all the steps are re-run

    - Non-local dependencies
    - Multiple output files
    - Build variable / rule changes

=== Non-Local Dependencies

  * Timestamp is used to determine if a rule is to be re-run

  * Integration build, requires for example to download files off the
    Internet

  * Make's timestamp mechanism is not sufficient

=== Multiple Output Files

  * Single build step, in a integration build can produce multiple
    output files

  * Example: configuring the bash source tree, produces multiple
    output files like `config.h`, `Makefile`, etc.

  * The generated files in some cases are not even known before hand

  * Example: extracting bash source tar ball

  * Make is not designed to handle multiple output files in a rule

=== Build Variable / Rule Changes

  * If a build rule changes, the rule will not be re-run

  * Make, tracks *only* the timestamps

  * Also changes to build variables are not tracked. 

=== BitBake

  * Make designed for building a single application

  * BitBake designed for building a whole stack of applications --
    integration build

    - Creates *stamp files* to identify if a build step has been
      completed

    - Generates and stores *checksums* of commands in build step and
      the build variables

    - Uses checksums to determine changes in build environment and
      trigger a re-build

    - *Caches* and reuses data from previous builds

  * Build a complete Embedded Linux Distribution: OpenEmbedded, Yocto
    Project

== Using BitBake

=== Setting Up BitBake

[source,shell]
------
include::code/simple/bbsetup.sh[]
------

  * Downloads BitBake, and unpacks it

  * BitBake is written in Python

  * Python is invoked to build and setup BitBake

  * BitBake is not installed in the standard `PATH`

  * Env. variables are setup to point to BitBake location


=== Simple Sandwich Project

  * Contains 2 files required by BitBake
    - `conf/bitbake.conf`
    - `classes/base.bbclass`

  * `bread.bb` is a recipe contains build instructions

  * Contents of `conf/bitbake.conf` will be discussed later-on

=== Tasks

  * The smallest unit of execution in BitBake is a task

  * Similar to rules in `make`

  * Task names start with `do_` prefix

  * General syntax is shown below
+
------
do_task1() {
    cmd1
    cmd2
}
addtask task1
------

=== Variables

  * Variables can be set using the following syntax
+
------
var = "value"
------
+
  * All variables are string variables
  * The value should be in double quotes
  * Some variables are special to BitBake

=== Baking Bread

  * Two tasks
    - `do_get`
    - `do_cook`

  * Variable
    - `PN` - name for the recipe (package name)

=== Invoking BitBake

  * Setup `BBPATH` to point to the project folder
+
[source,shell]
------
include::code/simple/bbpath.sh[]
------
+
  * Run the `do_get` task
  * Argument to `bitbake` specifies the recipe name
  * Option `-c` specifies the task name
+
[source,shell]
------
include::code/simple/run-get.sh[]
------

=== Invoking BitBake (2)

  * Commands run with `tmp` folder as current working directory

  * Run the `do_cook` task

  * Check the contents of `tmp/bread.txt`

=== Stamp Files

  * Try re-run of `do_cook`

  * Tasks if tried to re-run will not get executed

  * Stamp files are created in `tmp/stamps`

  * If stamp file is present the task will not be re-run

  * Delete `tmp`, and re-run `do_get` and `do_cook`

=== Ordering of Tasks

  * `do_get` should be executed before `do_cook`

  * Task ordering can be enforced by specifying in `addtask` directive
+
------
addtask cook after do_get
------
+
  * Modify `bread.bb`, delete `tmp` and re-run `bitbake`

=== Add Recipe for Omelet

------
include::code/simple/omelet.bb[]
------

=== Make Omelet

  * Try running the recipe's tasks

  * Check the output of the tasks

== Inter-Recipe Dependencies

=== Task Dependencies

  * Dependencies within a recipe, specified in `addtask`

  * Task in one recipe might depend upon task in other recipes

  * Create a recipe for a Sandwich

=== Add Recipe for Sandwich

------
include::code/simple/sandwich.bb[]
------

=== Make Sandwich

  * Delete `tmp`, and run `do_cook` of `sandwich`

  * Fails since `bread.txt` and `omelet.txt` required by `sandwich` is
    not present

  * Add to `sandwich.bb` the following
+
------
DEPENDS = "bread omelet"
do_get[deptask] = "do_cook"
------
+
  * Specifes that `do_get` of `sandwich` depends on `do_cook` of
    `bread` and `omelet`.

=== Variable and Task Flags

  * BitBake can assosiate flags with variables and tasks

  * General syntax is
+
------
var[flag] = "value"
------
+
  * `deptask` is a flag, the specifies that a particular task of
    recipes specified in `DEPENDS` should be executed first

== Configuration

=== BitBake Configuration

[source,shell]
------
include::code/simple/bitbake.conf[]
------

  * `TOPDIR` is automatically set by `bitbake` to the folder from which
    it is invoked

  * `TMPDIR` specifies locations where build output is stored.

=== Build Directories

`CACHE`:: directory to store parsed recipes

`STAMP`:: specifies location where stamp files are created

`T`:: specifies locations where logs and scripts are stored

`B`:: specifies location where tasks are executed

=== Executing Parallel Tasks

  * BitBake can execute multiple tasks in parallel

  * `BB_NUMBER_THREADS` specifies the max. number of tasks to run in
    parallel.

  * Set the variable in `bitbake.conf`.

  * Delete `tmp` folder and re-run the build of sandwich.

== Sharing Between Recipes

=== Base Class

  * `base.bbclass` is parsed for before each recipe is read

  * Common tasks and directives can be shared, in `base.bbclass`
+
------
PF = "${PN}"

addtask get
addtask cook after do_get

do_get[deptask] = "do_cook"
------
+
   * `PF` -- sort of Package Fullname, in Yocto contains the package
     name and version

=== Sharing Between Recipes

------
PN = "sandwich"

DEPENDS = "bread omelet"

do_get() {
        cat bread.txt > sandwich.txt
        cat omelet.txt  >> sandwich.txt
        sleep 1
}

do_cook() {
        echo "${PN}: toast bread and serve" >> sandwich.txt
        sleep 2
        echo "${PN}: ready" >> sandwich.txt
}
