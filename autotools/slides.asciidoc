== Root Filesystem

=== Kernel Boot Sequence

  * During boot up, kernel initializes its subsystems
  * Mounts the root filesystem
  * Executes `/sbin/init`, the first user space process

=== Root Filesystem

  * Contains the top level directories of the system
    - `bin`
    - `lib`
    - `etc`
    - `tmp`
    - `var`

  * Contains the first user space application, usually `init`
  * And all its dependencies

== Autotools Intro

=== Autotools

  * Many free software packages are written in C

  * Distributed as source and needs to be built

  * Use GNU Autotools for configuration and build

  * Configuration is primarily used for

    . Automatic Feature Selection
    . Manual Feature Selection

== Automatic Feature Selection

=== Unix Variants

  * Unix-like operating systems
    - Linux
    - Solaris
    - FreeBSD
    - NetBSD

  * Provide same set of commands and system calls
  * But differ in minor ways
  * Hard to write program that compiles / runs on all variants

=== OS Variations

  * Some systems do not have certain functions implemented, like
    `memcpy()`.

  * Some features are not supported in certain OS, like `mmap()`.

  * Some features have alternate implementations in each OS, like
    `poll()` and `select()`.

=== Supporting Multiple OS

  * Local implementation of functions not available.

  * Fallback implementation for unsupported OS features.

  * Choose specific feature provided by the OS.

=== OS Specific Macros

OS specific preprocessor macros to include / exclude code

------
#if defined(TINYBSD)
void *memcpy(...)
{
    ...
    ...
}
#endif
------

=== Problem

Every time a new OS is to be supported code needs to be updated

------
#if defined(TINYBSD) || defined(NANOLINUX) || defined(USOLARIS)
void *memcpy(...)
{
    ...
    ...
}
#endif
------

=== Feature Macros

Feature tests, a shell script checks for the presence of features
and creates a `config.h` file.

------
#define HAVE_MEMCPY
#define HAVE_MEMSET
#define HAVE_SELECT
#define HAVE_POLL
------

=== Feature Macros (Contd.)

  * These macros can be used within the program to do the right thing
+
------
#ifndef HAVE_MEMCPY
void *memcpy(...)
{
    ...
    ...
}
#endif
------
+
  * Future proof, any new OS without `memcpy()` is already supported.

=== Feature Probing

The shell script creates tiny programs, and checks for compilation
errors.

------
#include <string.h>
#incldue <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
  char a[2], b[2];
  memcpy(a, b, 2);
  return 0;
}
------

=== Autotools

  * Autotools generates a `configure` script to do feature probing

  * Generates `config.h` with results of the probe

  * Can also check for the presence of libraries

  * If feature is optional, will continue with macro indicating
    feature not available

  * If feature is required, will halt indicating feature is missing

=== Try Out

  * Goto `~/yp/dl`
  * Download bash from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3.tar.gz
+
[source,shell]
------
cd ~/yp/dl
wget -c http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3.tar.gz
------

=== Try Out (Contd.)

  * Goto `~/yp/auto`
  * Extract `bash-4.3.tar.gz`
+
[source,shell]
------
cd ~/yp/auto
tar -x -f ~/yp/dl/bash-4.3.tar.gz
------
+
  * Change into `bash-4.3` and run `./configure`, check the contents
    of `config.h`

== Manual Feature Selection

=== Manual Configuration

  * Kernel can be configured using a menu interface

  * Features required and not required can be selected

  * Application programs also require some form of manual feature
    selection.

  * Example
    - Build without GUI
    - Select from alternate: GTK GUI or QT GUI

=== Autotools

  * `configure` script allows user to specify what features are
    required through options.

  * Example: `--enable-gui=no`, `--with-gtk=yes`, `--with-qt=no`

  * These are recorded into `config.h` as well.

=== Try Out

  * Configure bash with history disabled 
+
------
./configure --enable-history=no
------
+
  * Is the `HISTORY` macro defined in `config.h`?
  * Now try configuring with history enabled

== Using Autotools

=== Building Programs

  * Programs that use Autotools can be built using the following
    sequence of commands.

------
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
------

  * The configure script does automatic feature selection.

  * Manual feature selection can be done by passing options to the
    configure script.

=== Cross Compilation

  * Autotools naming convention
    - `host` - system in which application will be executed (the
      target system)
    - `build` - system in which application is built

  * Systems are identified by a canonical name: `arch-vendor-kernel-os`

  * Example: `arm-none-linux-gnu`, `i686-pc-linux-gnu`, `sparc-sun-solaris`

=== Cross Compilation (Contd.)

  * The canononical name of the `host` is same as the prefix of the
    cross compiler

  * It is also recommended the `build` system also be specified during
    cross compilation
+
------
$ ./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu
$ make
$ make install
------

=== Try Out

  * Reconfigure `bash` for cross compile and build
+
------
./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu
make
------
+
  * Check the binary file architecture, using `file` command.

=== Program Prefix

  * In a manual build, programs assume to be installed in `/usr/local`

  * When the program wants to access it's data file, it does as
+
------
    fd = open("/usr/local/share/vlc/icon.png");
------
+
  * Package manager does not interfere with files present in
    `/usr/local/`.

=== Program Prefix (Contd.)

  * The program to reside under `/usr`, the `--prefix` option can be
    used
+
------
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
------
+
  * Creates a `PREFIX` macro definition in `config.h`.

  * All static data files are accessed relative to `PREFIX`.
+
------
    fd = open(PREFIX "/share/vlc/icon.png");
------

=== Try Out

  * Check the binary of strings containing `/usr/local/share`
+
------
strings bash | grep '/usr/local/share'
------
+
  * Reconfigure bash with `/usr` prefix, and check strings for
    `/usr/share`

=== Install Directory

  * Just `make install` installs into system folders

  * In a cross compile, install should copy files to root filesystem.

  * Specify the `DESTDIR` variable during `make install`.
+
------
$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/root
------

=== Try Out

  * Run `make install` (as non-root).

  * Run `make install` with `DESTDIR` set.
+
------
make install DESTDIR=~/yp/auto/rootfs
------
+
  * Verify the contents of `~/yp/auto/rootfs`

== Closing Notes

=== Summary

  * Many applications use the GNU Autotools build framework.

  * Autotools allows for automatic and manual feature selection.

  * Autotools supports cross-compilation through manual feature
    selection.
