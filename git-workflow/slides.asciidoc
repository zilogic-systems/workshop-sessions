== History Rewriting

=== Published vs Unpublished History

  * Published history
    - commit history that has been shared with other users

  * Unpublished history
    - commit history is local and not been shared with other users

  * Unpublished history can be modified!

=== Amending Commits

  * Commits are generally considered to be immutable

  * The last made commit, if unpublished can be updated

  * Make additional changes to working copy, invoke `git commit` with
    `--amend` option

  * Instead of a new commit, changes are added to the last commit

  * Useful when a file was forgotten, or a change was missed

=== Demo

  * Extract a fresh copy of `book.tar.gz`
  * Fix the spelling of freedom in `chapter-1.txt`
  * Make a commit
  * Fix the spelling of freedom in `chapter-2.txt`
  * Update the previous commit with the new changes

=== Try Out

  * Extract a fresh copy of `book.tar.gz`
  * Fix the spelling of freedom in `chapter-1.txt`
  * Make a commit
  * Fix the spelling of freedom in `chapter-2.txt`
  * Update the previous commit with the new changes

=== Merging vs Rebasing

[role="left"]
image::figures/merge-rebase-1.png[align="center",width="50%"]

[role="right"]
  * Changes can be incorporated from another branch in two ways
  
    - Merging
    - Rebasing

[role="two-column"]
=== Merging

[role="left"]
image::figures/merge-rebase-2.png[align="center",width="50%"]

[role="right"]
  * Creates a new merge commit

  * Commit contains the additional changes from another branch, merged
    into current branch
+
-----
git checkout year-fix
git merge master
-----

[role="two-column"]
=== Rebasing

[role="left"]
image::figures/merge-rebase-3.png[align="center",width="50%"]

[role="right"]
  * Commits on the current branch are re-applied onto the tip
    of another branch

  * New commit objects are re-written
    - Point to new content
    - SHA1 of commits are different from previous commits
+
-----
git checkout year-fix
git rebase master
-----

=== Demo

  * Extract a fresh copy of `book.tar.gz`

  * `chapter-3.txt` has an year missing, in line 8

  * Create a bug-fix branch called `year-fix`

  * Insert `1984` instead of `????` in line 8

  * Commit the changes

=== Demo (Contd.)

  * Switch to `master` branch

  * Fix the spelling of the word `long` in `chapter-3.txt`, line 6

  * Commit the change

=== Demo (Contd.)

  * Switch to `year-fix` branch

  * Incorporate the new changes in `master`, using `rebase`
+
------
git rebase master
------

=== Try Out

  * Extract a fresh copy of `book.tar.gz`

  * `chapter-3.txt` has an year missing, in line 8

  * Create a bug-fix branch called `year-fix`

  * Insert `1984` instead of `????` in line 8

  * Commit the changes

=== Try Out (Contd.)

  * Switch to `master` branch

  * Fix the spelling of the word `long` in `chapter-3.txt`, line 6

  * Commit the change

=== Try Out (Contd.)

  * Switch to `year-fix` branch

  * Incorporate the new changes in `master`, using `rebase`
+
------
git rebase master
------

=== Rebasing Conflicts

  * Just like merges, conflicts can occur during a rebase

  * Each commit is applied one at a time

  * When a commit does not apply cleanly, rebase stops

  * Indicates the conflicting changes with markers

  * Resolve the conflict, and do a `git rebase --continue`

  * Not a commit is not required

  * The rebase can also be aborted using `git rebase --abort`

=== Advantages of Rebase

  * In both cases, `year-fix` incorporates the new changes from master

  * Rebase maintains a cleaner history, without too many unnecessary
    merges

  * Thumb-rule:
    - Use rebase for local topic branches
    - Use merge published development / bug-fix branches

== Workflows

=== Overview

  * Series of activities need to complete a task

  * Centralized Workflow
    - small team of trusted developers

  * Forking Workflow
    - allows collaboration among a larger group of developers
    - provides a mechanism for reviewing changes

== Centralized Workflow

=== Everyone Clones Central Repo

image::figures/central-1.png[width="50%",align="center"]

=== UserA Pushes Changes

=== UserB Push Fails

== Forking Workflow

[role="two-column"]
=== Getting Started

[role="left"]
image::figures/gh-1.png[]

[role="right"]
  * GitHub and GitLab allows users to create projects

  * For each project a Git repo is created

  * An issue tracker, and wiki is also created

  * Projects have the name `owner/proj-name`

  * Only the owner has write access to project

=== User Forks Project

image::figures/gh-2.png[width="50%",align="center"]

  * When a user wants to contribute, to a project, the user forks the
    project

  * Creates a new project `user/proj`, clones the project into the Git
    repo

=== Topic Branch and Commit

image::figures/gh-2.png[width="50%",align="center"]

  * This project is writable by the user

  * User now clones his Git repo, and publishes topic branch

=== Topic Branch and Commit (Contd.)

image::figures/gh-tree-1.png[width="25%",align="center"]

=== Create Pull Request

image::figures/gh-3.png[width="50%",align="center"]

  * User creates a Pull Request (PR), in owner's project

  * Pull request indicates that a set of commits, is ready for inclusion

=== Review Feedback

image::figures/gh-4.png[width="50%",align="center"]

  * Owner fetches the changes and reviews the changes

  * Provides feedback, if not satisfied, user can commit to topic
    branch, and push

=== Review Feedback

image::figures/gh-tree-2.png[width="25%",align="center"]

=== Close PR

image::figures/gh-5.png[width="50%",align="center"]

  * Owner merges the changes and pushes to his repo

  * Closes Pull Request

=== Merge Options

  * GitHub allows topic branch to be merged from UI

  * Automatic merge options, on GitHub
    - Merge
    - Squash and Merge
    - Rebase Merge

  * Manual merge in case of conflict
    - Owner
    - User

=== Master Advances Before Merge

== Tidbits

=== Stash

  * When merging and rebasing the working copy and staging should be
    clean

  * Changes can be temporarily stored and restored using
+
------
$ git stash
$ git stash pop
------

=== Reflog

  * In case after a rebase, the original head is required, it can be
    retreived from the Reflog

  * Reflog contains a history of all SHA1s assumed by HEAD
+
------
$ git reflog
------

=== Relative Refs

  * Instead of specifing actual SHA1s, relative refs can be used

  * `HEAD`: is the checked out commit

  * `HEAD^`: is the parent of the checked-out commit

  * `HEAD^^`: is the grand-parent of the checked-out commit

  * Relative refs are useful when fiddling around with branches and
    commits
+
------
git checkout -b bugfix HEAD^
------
